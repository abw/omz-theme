# Installation

You first need to have Z shell and Oh My Zsh installed.

https://ohmyz.sh/

Clone this repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:abw/omz-theme.git

 Copy the `themes/abw.zsh-theme` file to your `.oh-my-zsh/themes` directory.

    $ cp omz-theme/themes/abw.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes

Then enable the theme by editing your `~/.zshrc` file and setting the `ZSH_THEME` to `"abw"`.

    ZSH_THEME="abw"

The new theme will then take effect when you launch a new `zsh`.
